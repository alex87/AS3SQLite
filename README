This has been a free-time project of mine - getting a proper SQLite library up and running for AS3.

I've devoted quite some time to it, and now I'm sharing it with everyone in the hope that you guys will help out :)

A note of warning: If you are expecting me to do ALL the development myself, be warned: updates will be fairly infrequent - Mechanical Engineering really requires a lot of time :)

On the other hand, you can fork this, build on this, go wild!! Be sure to give back to the project, though.
